Welcome to the NetDaemon project!

NetDaemon is an application daemon that enables you to write powerful home automation scripts in C# for Home Assistant. This repository contains **NetDaemon V5**, the latest version of the framework.

## About NetDaemon

NetDaemon was founded by [@helto4real](https://github.com/helto4real) in 2020 as a personal project to explore the use of C# in Home Assistant. Early contributions from [@Ludeeus](https://github.com/ludeeus) helped integrate NetDaemon with Home Assistant. The project gained significant momentum when [@FrankBakkerNl](https://github.com/FrankBakkerNl) joined and introduced the HassModel API, which leverages code generation to create a user-friendly experience.

Currently, [@helto4real](https://github.com/helto4real) and [@FrankBakkerNl](https://github.com/FrankBakkerNl) serve as the primary maintainers, though many others have contributed over the years.

        if (motionSensor.IsOn() && hallwayLight.IsOff()){
            hallwayLight.TurnOn();
        }

        // Subscribe to changes in the state of the motion sensor
        motionSensor.StateChanges()
            .Where(e => e.New?.IsOn() ?? false)
