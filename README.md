Welcome to the NetDaemon project. This is the application daemon that allows you to write your home automations in C# for Home Assistant. We are currently working on a new API, the HassModel that will replace the V2 API eventually. We encourage users to use this API starting out with NetDaemon. We are working hard to add more features that corresponds to the old V2 API.

Please see [https://netdaemon.xyz](https://netdaemon.xyz) for detailed instructions how to get started using NetDaemon.

> **The NetDaemon project is stable but is still in development so expect things to change.**
