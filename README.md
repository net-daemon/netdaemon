Welcome to the NetDaemon project. This is the application daemon for Home Assistant for people that love to write code in the .NET ecosystem and want to do their automation for Home Assistant in .NET and C#.

Please see [https://netdaemon.xyz](https://netdaemon.xyz) for detailed instructions how to get started using NetDaemon.

> **The NetDaemon is currently in alpha release so expect things to change.**

## Docker Support

For those who have Homeassistant running on Docker, not supervised by HASS, the NetDaemon can be shipped as a container and ran in parallel.

You can deploy the container using the following command. It is advised to map the `/data` folder of the container to a local folder as the daemon's apps are linked to this folder.

The following environment variables are available to identify your Home Assistant instance
* `HASS_HOST`, defaults to *localhost*
* `HASS_PORT`, default to *8123*
* `HASS_TOKEN` needs to be set to a valid access token.
* `HASS_GEN_ENTITIES`, defaults to False, set True if you want the autogenerated entities

Example giving:
```
docker run -d \
  --name netdaemon \
  --restart=always \
  -e HASS_HOST=192.168.1.1 \
  -e HASS_TOKEN=XXXXX \
  -e HASS_GEN_ENTITIES=False \
  -v ~/netdaemon_config:/data \
  netdaemon/netdaemon
```

## Companion App (Home Assistant)

For the full user experiance please download and copy the netdaemon companion component to the `custom_components` folder of your Home Assistant configuration. The companion app registers basic services that are required for the service attributes as well as the dynamic app reload / discovery feature.

Do not forget to add the component to your Home Assistant configuration file afterwards.

```
homeassistant:
  customize: !include customize.yaml
...
netdaemon:
```

Please check out the apps being developed for netdaemon. Since documentation is still lacking behind it will be best looking at real code 😊
