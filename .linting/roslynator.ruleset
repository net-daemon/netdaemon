This rule set can be used to:

 1) Enable/disable analyzer(s) by DEFAULT.
 2) Change DEFAULT severity (action) of the analyzer(s).

Default configuration is applied once when analyzers are loaded.
Therefore, it may be neccessary to restart IDE for changes to take effect.

Although it is possible to edit ruleset manually, Visual Studio has built-in support for editing ruleset.
Just add ruleset file to a solution and open it.
